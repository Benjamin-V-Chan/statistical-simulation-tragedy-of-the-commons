# =====================================
#
# Import packages (pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy).
# Define the main function:
#   - Load simulation_results.csv from outputs.
#   - Compute average resource and cooperation fraction over generations across replicates.
#   - Plot the time series:
#         * Average resource vs. generation.
#         * Average fraction_cooperators vs. generation.
#   - Create a scatter plot:
#         * For each replicate at the final generation, plot resource vs. fraction_cooperators.
#   - Save all plots as PNG images in the outputs folder.
# Run the main function.
